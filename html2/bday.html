                    This year was full with unexpected happenings . Many got girlfriends and many are going through breakup .Some are above them and sleeping most of their time and yeah its true, we are homesick now , we need any reason to get off the bed and to go outside , meet friends play basketball and eat each other's brain off and i need those warm hugs of yours .uff man i am missing those long talks around the pond and times when i used to call just to share my problems with you . We were getting close , damn this lockdown and pandemic . <br> hope we can play basketball soon .

                    Well i am done with my bakwas now , all those were written just to flatter you . Well , we are sick and tired of doing character sketch of each and every character in our litrature book and MOV , but the this same thing has improved our skill of knowing what characteristic behaviour of each other and have a better taste in making friends  ( still flattering i guess ) . 
                    You are a nice talker , i never get a conversational problem with you , it true most of the time it's you who talk and i being a good listener (self-praise) listens to very small details of your story. You are so friendly na , ab iske baare mein kya hi bolu . Everybody knows your friendly nature and i want you to be sure that you have a super friend like me with you , that's me yeah i know you got that ðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆðŸ™ˆ.
